An Arduino sketch that takes sound level values from [this microphone](http://www.emartee.com/product/42148/Mini%20Sound%20Sensor) and writes them to an SD card every tenth of a second.

Included are some sample R commands to clean up and visualize the output data, as well as a sample data file if you want to play around.
